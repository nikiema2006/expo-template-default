# Overview
ScolaLink is a mobile application built with React Native and Expo designed for students. It provides a unified digital environment for academic tracking, school communication, homework management, classroom life, and administrative updates. The app addresses the lack of centralized, student-friendly platforms in many educational institutions, especially in contexts where digital tools are underutilized.

# Core Features
1. **Student Profile**
   - Unique student ID (QR code/matricule), personal and family info, photo, class history.
   - Importance: Builds identity and facilitates attendance, communication, and tracking.

2. **Academic Performance Tracking**
   - Interactive scoreboards, dynamic progress graphs, global/class averages.
   - Importance: Motivates students and helps track strengths/weaknesses.

3. **Ranking System**
   - Class leaderboard, monthly badges, top 3 display.
   - Importance: Encourages academic engagement through gamification.

4. **Schedule View**
   - Weekly planner, color-coded subjects, daily highlights, alerts.
   - Importance: Improves time management.

5. **Subject-Based Class Community**
   - Real-time group chat with teachers and peers, file sharing, polls.
   - Importance: Encourages collaboration and fast clarification.

6. **General Announcements**
   - School-wide news, event calendar, push notifications.
   - Importance: Keeps students informed.

7. **Private Messaging (Admin > Student)**
   - Behavior notices, convocations, private alerts.
   - Importance: Ensures direct and confidential communication.

8. **Attendance Management**
   - Attendance logs, absence graphs, justification tracking.
   - Importance: Reinforces accountability and parental transparency.

9. **Report Cards**
   - Monthly and term reports in secured PDF, digital signature for parents.
   - Importance: Simplifies delivery and archiving.

10. **School Journal**
    - Student articles, interviews, media, moderated comments.
    - Importance: Boosts expression and community building.

11. **Smart Notifications**
    - Customizable alerts for grades, homework, events.
    - Importance: Keeps students updated without overload.

# User Experience
- **Personas**: Middle/high school students aged 12–18.
- **User Flow**: Login → Dashboard → View schedule, notes, messages, tasks → Chat → Submit homework.
- **UI/UX**: Mobile-first, clean dashboard, color-coded UI, minimal clicks, accessible offline for key features.

# Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: React Native + Expo (TypeScript)
- **Backend**: Firebase / Supabase (auth, DB, storage)
- **Real-time messaging**: Firebase Realtime DB or Socket.io
- **Push Notifications**: Expo Notification API
- **PDF Storage & Delivery**: Firebase Storage / Cloud Functions
- **APIs**: Google Calendar (events), QR Code generation, PDF generation
- **Infrastructure**: Serverless, scalable (Cloud Functions + NoSQL)

# Development Roadmap
### Phase 1 – MVP
- Authentication (QR + Email/Password)
- Student profile module
- Notes dashboard with graphs
- Schedule view
- Homework section (upload/download)
- Notifications (basic)
- Chat per subject (basic, Firebase)
- Basic absence tracking
- Report card viewer

### Phase 2 – Core Extensions
- Announcements (general/private)
- School journal section
- Advanced presence tracking (QR attendance)
- Bulletin generation & signature
- Full notification settings
- Chat enhancements (polls, voice messages)

### Phase 3 – Future Enhancements
- Offline sync (local storage)
- Parental access version
- Incident reporting system
- Student calendar & planner
- Gamified ranking system

# Logical Dependency Chain
1. Setup authentication and database structure
2. Profile & notes modules (user data first)
3. Schedule and homework (core use cases)
4. Chat and presence tracking
5. Report cards & PDF
6. Journals & announcements
7. Notifications full logic
8. Optional: Offline sync and advanced features

# Risks and Mitigations
- **Technical**: Real-time sync — use Firebase or handle retries locally.
- **MVP clarity**: Define exactly what student needs daily — prioritize those features.
- **Resource**: If solo/small team, use managed backend services (Firebase/Supabase) to reduce infrastructure overhead.

# Appendix
- UI design inspiration: Google Classroom, Notion, Apple Schoolwork
- Research: UNESCO digital learning reports, EdTech UX best practices
- Specs: React Native SDK 50+, Expo SDK, Firebase 10+, use TypeScript throughout
